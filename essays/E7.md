# Course Goals ITM 352
## Acquiring basic programming skills in an IT context
- **Understanding why MIS people need basic programming skills and knowledge**  
  People within MIS may need to know basic programming skills and knowledge for tasks such as data management, automation of processes, customization and adaptation of exisiting technology to further fit needs. Also, the skill of algorithmic thinking is essential for MIS people.

- **Gaining hands-on experience in developing software applications**  
  In this class we had many hands-on experiences that allowed us to develop software applications. The labs themselves were pretty hands on, and allowed us to be guided through for an initial lesson, which prepared our minds to figure it out on our own. The WODs were also the main hands-on experience in this class, especially after the screencast lectures weren't provided. This gradual decline in the amount of support given for us eased into students become more competent, confident and problem solving.

- **Experiencing first-hand MIS problems and solutions**  
  I think an example of MIS problems and solutions can be very general, such as trying to figure out things you dont know. In this class, unless you already know how to code for developing websites, requires that you be a critical thinker and a problem solver. Outside of coding, I think this is a takeaway from this class, is the aspects of problem solving, and learning to learn.

- **Experiencing and understanding first-hand project management, working in teams, software development issues**  
  In this class, we didn't directly work in teams, however I feel that the class was very engrained in each others progress, and always discussing the class assigmments overall, especially before class. In project management, it gives a perspective into what kinds of things may go into managing a project such as the creation of a website, and how in-depth and detailed you must be. It is up to a project manager to ensure those things get done, which requires a specific attention to detail.

- **Gaining confidence in addressing MIS problems**  
  In the beggining of the semester it was very daunting trying to figure out issues when I had them. As we progressed, I realized that issues were an inherent part of coding, and application system development. For me, it was all about leveraging the techbology around me to address issues, which lead to further competency later down the line. My process would usually to be to look at the console and any red errors, and if that didnt work, I would run it through ChatGPT, asking the robot to fix any errors.

# Course Elements and Personal Engagement
- **What did you learn from creating a professional portfolio and using it in ITM 352?**  
  I learned the value of coding/programming, and how it can possibly make you stand out to potential employers. This professional portfolio captures our resume, but also the work and reflections we did in this class, which gives employer more substance to judge for hiring, boosting our chances, especially in ITM internship roles.

- **What did you gain from doing the WODs?**  
  WODs were the real part of the class where I feel I learned the most. The labs were good, but I never fully understood the content and material after leaving a lab lecture, as I needed a way to apply that knowledge, and further reinforce my learning. For that aspect of learning, WODs were extremely  helpful.

- **Were the quizzes helpful in preparing you for the labs?**  
    Yes, many of the times the quizzes had almost identical information to the labs, and would lay the general idea and framework of what we eventually covered in the lab. I also found value in the quizzes when I was working on the WODs, as I noticed it always had the essential information that I would need to brush up on.

- **What did you learn from doing the labs?**  
  From the labs, I learned the "Why" behind programming and coding. The readings before provided good context, but the labs were a run through and explanation of "why" we do certain things certain ways. This context behind the code supplied me with the knowledge I needed to understand how and why things are done. It also introduced me to small steps and details to come in the WOD.

- **What did you learn from doing the essays?**  
  In the essays, I learned a lot about myself, my learning styles, what I needed improvements on, and what I was strong in. The most valuable takeaway though was the realization of what I needed to further work on, which I usually applied myself to do in the next assigment/WOD/lab. Reflecting is great, because it gets you to think of things you may not have covered, and helps you truly learn from your mistakes and wins.

- **What did you learn from doing Assignment 1 and Assignment 2?**  
    In Assigment one I learned about the basics of creating an e-store. This estore included basic validation for the forms, basic algorithmic thinking for the invoice and also introductory user interface/experience design. In assigment two, I reinforced those programming aspects ,further building my confidence and competency, improving my code and adding new elements. Assigment two also taught further details of applications systems and websites, such as using it as a tool for getting data in a business standpoint. This is done by login and registration pages. From a business aspect, this allows you to network to your customer base more effectively, and possibly increase revenue/sales. Also, I learned how to personalize the site based on user, boosting user experience, and worked on my code debugging skills. I had  a lot of issues in assigment two, but was far more comfortable in addressing them and fixing it than I was in the first.

# Challenges and Achievements
- **Detail the specific challenges you encountered during the course, such as understanding new programming concepts, completing WODs, web application development assignments.**  
    In the begining of the class, I had a lot of issues, because of that first syntactic learning hump. This was very discouraging at first, and tested my patience and persistence. This understanding of "What am I doing" as well as "Why am I doing this", didnt come until probably assigment one, where I felt actually confident and strong in my abilities to create and edit application systems. I wouldn't say I did the best job at it at the time, but that is where I got a stronger understanding and confidence in my capabilities.

- **Explain how you overcame these challenges and the strategies that helped you succeed.**  
  Time and practice. This was one of my most time intenseful classes. I feel that this semester, I focused on this class too much in a way. I focused on it "too much" because I didn't do my other classes as well as I should have, but also because I thoroughly enjoyed this class, the content and the style of teaching. By fully immersing myself in the process of learning and coding, it became much easier to overcome issues as my perspective on stress and the work had been changed, allowing me to be more comfortable and interested.

- **Highlight any particular achievements or milestones in the course that were significant to you.**  
I would say the biggest first achievement was Assigment one. I spent a lot of time on Assigment one, and viewd it as the accumulation of everything I had been working on in class. In contrast to the first assigment we did, the spinning smatphoneproducts lab, assigment one felt like leaps and bounds ahead of it. The fact that we were allowed to create the website of our choosing, with the style we wanted, to the products/services, I feel that it made me more interested in doing a good job on it, as I could build on my vision rather than simply finish an assigment.

# Skill Development and Application
- **Reflect on the three skill levels outlined in the course (syntactic, algorithmic, application)**  
  In syntactic skills for coding and programming, I would say I was able to get an alright grasp on the concepts. Compared to when I first started the class however, it is a great improvement. The syntactic skill level is understanding the syntax, and structure of coding languages. One thing I noticed now too, is that just a syntactic level of understanding in javascript has carried over a little bit to reading other languages. This doesnt mean I can read other languages, however I can gain a better understanding of it with less research than before. I definitely think there is lots of room for improvement.

    After learning syntactic skills, we moved onto an algorithmic thinking/skillset. I thoroughly enjoyed the algorithmic aspect of it, as I feel it was the least coding specific activity, to which I viewed it more as a fun challenge and puzzle. WODs such as MakingChange or DayOfTheWeek allowed for students to beginn to learn how to address issues, create algorithms and think in the correct ways. A lot of the algorithm WODS and activities required a different, slower and more meaningful type of thinking, rather than testing how good our syntactic understanding was (although still needing proper syntax.)

    We left off this semester with Assigment two, as we were not able to get to Assigment three, because of time restraints. However, I feel that just from assigments 1 and 2, the class was able to get a good idea of the application skill level of coding. That is precisely what we did in both assigments, with a lot of help of course. Application skill level was very broad, and an accumulation of both syntactic understanding, and algorithmic. Within this level of understanding, students were able to get a grasp of what working on larger-scale project was like. This was very confusing, but luckily we had lots of support and templates to work off of, which allowed us to learn, without having to spend hours and hours trying to create it from scratch.

- **Describe how the hands-on experience with web-based e-service applications enhanced your understanding and confidence in handling MIS issues.**  
  The hands-on experience in web-base e-serviceallowed to to get a more full and detailed perspective of the things that go into creating a web applications. Knowing the functions and details behind the user interface, allowed me to create a more full user experience, which is better for not only the user and also from a buisness owner standpoint. 
  Also, the general idea of problem solving was improved upon in this class, as it took a lot of patience, researching and rereading to tackle problems in which I was facing issues. Many of the times, I found that my code had very minor errors, which could be fixed by taking a step back, and really thinking about the larger picture, rather than being so direct and straightforward about it. 
  My main takeaway from hands-on experience in understanding and building my confidence in handling MIS issues, is what to look for and simply, researching to overcome issues you are facing.

# Use of AI (e.g. ChatGBT)
- **Discuss how use of AI enhanced your learning and productivity. Give specific examples of how you used AI effectively.**  
 I found ChatGPT to be extremely helpful. One of the main ways I used it was to check for issues, and debug my code. Many of the times, this use of Chat GPT helped a lot, without giving me wrong stuff, allowing me to speed up my progress. Chat GPT also helped a lot in creating code, although it can be very iffy at times. The more complciated something is, and the bigger the segment of code youre trying to create, the less likely ChatGPT will be able to correctly help you. This success in using ChatGPT is dependent on how you use it though, as there are ways I found which work better, and also worse.
 Specific examples of how I would use ChatGPT to my advantage in this class is to start off with defining the overall mission of the robot, and assigning a role to it. A common one I have used is, 
 "You are a web developer, who specializes in Javascript, HTML and CSS. Immerse yourself in these programming languages, as I will be asking for help in regards to my class, 'Programming Application Systems'."
 To me, this introduced the idea to the robot, so it can gain more context in the areas it needs to. This wont make the robot give you the correct information everytime, however I feel that it does a good job of setting a mission, and providing context of the activity.
 For specific issues and new implementations, I would explain all of the issue in depth, define what the outcomme I want is, then list requirements and things to avoid. Lastly, before asking the robot to create and write the code, i'll typically ask it to ask me a fice (or more) questions in regards to the implementation. After this, the AI asks me about details I may have missed, and questions regarding the function and "how" behind the code implementation. I found that this was by far the most important thing to do while creating and using ChatGPT for code creation, as there are so many possible missocmmunications and discrepancies, that this will target the issues that you might not have though of addressing. 
 By doing this, you can create more effecient code, that is more tailored to your program. 
 Also, when using ChatGPT, outline your whole project as much as possible to the chat, and provide all examples which may be affected inthe fucntion. This ensures that the code more properly fits into your exisitng program seamlessly without issues.

- **Discuss how use of AI inhibited your learning or and productivity. Give specific examples of how you used AI ineffectively.**  
  The main issues that arose when using ChatGPT is when I would get frusturated and impatient, and started to use it improperly. This means that I would not properly direct the AI as I did in the proper uses of ChatGPT (providing adequate context, explaining in detail, asking for clarifying questions and criteria). A general rule of thumb I found to work is;
  (a) - The larger the code being written, the more context is needed for proper implementation
  (b) - Explain less, and doing less will result in more errors. The more explaining you do to ChatGPT, the less errors and implemntation you will have to focus on.
  (c) - If you implement faulty solutions that you haven't double checked, the AI will work off that, resulting in much larger issues down the road.
  (d) - Make sure you are in control and undertanding of the code. if you dont understand something thoroughly, be careful in implementation.

  In conclusion, the effect of AI on your code all depends on the context you give it, whether it is enough or if it is correct/incorrect. One large piece of advice to avoid issues when using ChatGPT is use it deliberately and carefully, as it amplifies your ability to write code. If your code is good and consistent, with proper instruction, it can be taken to new levels to help you. However, if you have faulty code, and bad habits regarding AI use, it will end up harming you more than benefiting.

# Future Implications and Professional Growth
- **Explore how the skills and knowledge gained from ITM 352 can be applied in your future academic and professional endeavors.**  
  ITM352 taught many hard skills, as well as soft skills. In hard skills, it taught the basics of Programming Application Systems, which include syntactic, algorithmic and applicational understanding. In soft skills, critical thinking, persistence and research skills were taught. So regardless of whether one goes into MIS, entrepreneurship or other corporate roles, I feel that there are valuable skills and knowledge that have been instilled in students. Just an overall basic understanding of technology, and technological mediums such as websites is a very valuable skill to have, especially in such a increasingly digital and technological based society. Overall, i think the main takeaway that will carry over to any path students take, is the critial thinking skills gained in this class. To be able to sit down and address issues that you are not comfortable with, increase skills in general problem solving, as it makes us confident in our troubleshooting process/techniques.

- **Discuss the potential impacts these skills will have on your career, especially in terms of understanding and addressing MIS problems.**  
 This critical thinking will allow and guide students to navigate more complex issues when they get into MIS roles. Even if someone doesn't know as much programming as others, I feel that the aspects of critical thinking and troubleshooting covered in this class will carry over in many ways to our careers. Also I feel that proper habits and practices regarding programming were instilled in this class, which will most definetely carry over to careers. Good habits such as proper naming of variables, organization and commenting will make students stand out in a good way, regardless of their technical coding proficiency.

- **Reflect on the overall value of the course in your educational journey and future career.**  
    Going into this class, I was very scared and intimidated, as I feel that technology and more specifically, coding and programming, is not one of my strongest areas. Also, going into ITM352, was the first class regarding the MIS major. To me, I see MIS as a large opportunity, especially in comparison to Finance. I didn't know what exactly I wanted to do in Finance, as it is so broad. Going into MIS make me excited, as it is a more technical, and specific career path. I know there are many different fields within MIS and IT, but i very much enjoy the focus and expertise of MIS based careers, especially the web development part. The fist month was very difficult, but after that, I began to truly enjoy the content of the class, and no longer felt that it was "out of my wheelhouse."     
    I am extremely excited to continue my path in MIS, as I have come to enjoy it more than Finance, which is originally why I went to college. With technology on the rise, and the world becoming more and more dependent on data and data systems, I see MIS as a huge opportunity and growing sector. Combined with MIS and Finance, I am excited to leverage technology to further my understanding and capabilities I can provide to an omployer, or hopefully apply it to an entreprenuerial endeavor someday. Even if I were to not go into an MIS role, I am extremely thankful for the practices and habits I have acquired in this class. Going forward into MIS, I really would like to not only pass the classes and get good grades, but I want to become skilled and competent in coding and technology. 
    As far as career-wise, I want to get into project management. I feel that this course gave a good introductory view into all aspects of MIS , such as security, networking and project management. In project management, I  was able to see the vast amounts of tasks, and the details behind them which need to be accounted for. I have also been looking into MIS internships, to which hopefully I can accept one, and gain further hands-on experience in the MIS world. This class has equipped students with the proper tools, knowledge and skills they need to succeed in the field, now it is up to us to properly apply all that we have learned to progress professionally.
