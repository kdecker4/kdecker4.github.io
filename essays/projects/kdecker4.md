My name is Kalani Decker, I am a third year student at the Shidler College of Business studying Finance! I am expected to graduate in the spring of 2025, in which I was also curious in pursuing a double major in MIS, as I have leftover electives and credits which I could use for another degree. I am very excited to be in ITM352 because I want to become more competent and knowledable of technology, and how to leverage it to become a better and more effecient worker/person. 
I grew up on Oahu, in Palolo Valley. I also attended Kalani High School, and before that, Kaimuki Middle School. In the future, I am certain I want to live on Oahu as it is home to me, due to my family being here and the unique culture within the islands.
