#  Provide a brief introduction to the assignment along with a link to this page for further details
https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/150.Assignment2/experience-Assignment2.html

Above is Assigment 2. The purpose of assigment two was to build off of our e-store in assigment one, which had the capabiilities of inventory management and trasactions. In assigment two we focused on creating and building a login/registration system/pages. This required validation, basic secrurity measures and file i/o.

# What did you learn from this assignment?
Data persistence, proper redirection of pages, basic security and even encryption (although i didnt implement it in my project as it was not my IR.)
I also reinforced my skills regarding overall structure of code, and organization/management of my code. I also did much better in the testing troubleshooting process.
# Did you work with a partner? Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself).
I did not work with a partner, altough Professor Port helped me out a lot, and was a great help.
 # How did you get help when you needed it? What did you need help with?
I got help a lot in part from Professor Port, as he was available on discord and was very informative, and helped me understand it better.

I also got help from a couple classmates, who were able to give me some pointers. 
Using chatgpt was also a big help, as it was a way to get semi personalized feedback.
My main issues I needed help with was kind of taking the next step. A lot of the times I feel stuck and paralyzed, as I get overwhelmed with the amount of things I have to do. Having guidance and pointers from people who know what to do is a very large help, as it gives you direction that you can take.

 # How was developing this assignment different than assignment #1?
This was definetely more complex and in depth than assigment one, as there was more things to keep track of, such as the user data and all the components. It can be easy to become confused when there are so many different factors you have to account for. This made assigment two much more intensive on proper data management and organization of code. Also it was more imperative to know how the code worked, as there was more complicated javascript.

# Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing,) (c) testing and debugging
In the beginning I was doing probably like 60% writing code, 30% testing and debugging and around 10% actually thinking. After talking to port and having a one on one discussion and him helping me, I realized I had to be more strategic when it came to my apprach.

After adjusting, i'd say around 40% thinking, 20% writing, and 40% testing/debugging. This approach was much more successful and not as frusturating, as I was getting less errors than I previously had.

# Describe what worked well with this project? What did not work well?
Something that worked not well that I realized about halfway through was the undisciplined practice of just throwing code in. I had a bad habit of doing this at first, and would get really stressed that it wasn't working, so I would find any code and input where I though it would be without really thinking. This lead me to end up with a bunch of jumble and jargan of code, which was very faulty and issue prone. This often didnt take very long to do either, as I would get lost and confused, so I woudl forget what I needed to delete.

# If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you do differently?
I would definitely bee more disiplined and precise with my code, as I feel that at times, I hurt myself more than I helped with my poor habits of trying to use outside code in an unorganized fashion.
